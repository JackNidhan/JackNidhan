- 👋 Hi, I’m Jack Nidhan
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my programming and data science expertise to thrive in today’s tech-driven world
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science tools and languages like Python, R, and SQL to enhance my ability to work with large datasets and perform statistical analysis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that integrate data science and technology to create impactful solutions, especially but not exclusively to the field of precision medicine. 
- 📫 You can reach me via email at jack.nidhan@gmail.com or via linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/gjnx99/
- ⚡ Fun fact: To date, I have rescued over 500 animals that had been found injured,abandoned,trapped or simply entered human premises. But keep in mind, animals don't encroach on human territory; humans do.
