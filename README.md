- 👋 Hi, I’m Jack Nidhan, a fresh graduate looking to start the career of his dreams.
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my programming and data science expertise to thrive in today’s tech-driven world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science tools and languages like Python, R, and SQL to enhance my ability to work with large datasets and perform statistical analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that integrate data science and technology to create impactful solutions, especially but not exclusively to the field of precision medicine. 
- 📫 You can reach me via email at jack.nidhan@gmail.com or via linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/gjnx99/
- ⚡ Fun fact: To date, I have rescued over 500 animals that had been found injured,abandoned,trapped or had simply entered human premises. Some food for thought – can we really blame animals for encroaching on human territory when we continue to strip Mother Nature of her beauty to satisfy our endless greed?
